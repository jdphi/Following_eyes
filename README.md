# Following_eyes
This project creates a pair of eyes with CSS and allows them to follow a 
user's cursor using JavaScript. Depending on the position of the mouse 
cursor, the eyes will react in a particular way.

To improve this project, I would add a feature 'onclick' that allows the 
eyes to blink temporarily. I think this would make a fun and more 
interactive addition to the project.
